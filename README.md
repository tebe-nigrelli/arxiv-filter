# arxiv-filter
Utility code to filter the Arxiv database.

Crawler that searches, downloads, unzips and (soon) identifies citations in order to repeat the process.

The current project is 'work-in-progress' and severely limited by the amount of free time that university leaves me.

Thank you to arXiv for use of its open access interoperability. Without it, this project would be quite harder.
